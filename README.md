# Cake Web
Cake framework focuses on web development, striving for maximum simplicity. Unlike many other frameworks, which often burden developers with extensive libraries, numerous annotations, and complex configuration files that obscure the underlying Java code, Cake Web aims to achieve two key goals. Firstly, it seeks to be a framework where developers only need a solid understanding of Java code and the HTTP protocol to construct an API. Secondly, efficiency is paramount. The more layers of code separating an HTTP request from the API's core functionality, the less efficient the processing becomes. Therefore, our solution was to significantly minimize the framework's own codebase.

Clean Architecture principles emphasize that an application's design should inherently communicate its function. When developers are compelled to use an abundance of annotations, configuration files, and various interface implementations, the application's actual purpose can easily get lost in the noise. To address this, we've made a deliberate choice to rely solely on the Java language's capabilities for handling incoming HTTP requests and routing them to the appropriate business logic. This approach makes API description entirely Java-centric. For example, imagine you need to respond to a request for /theapi/thepath/theresource. You would simply define a package named theapi.thepath and a class within it called TheResource. There's no need for this class to implement any interfaces or extend other classes; instead, each HTTP verb required for the API is handled by a method in the class bearing the same name as the verb.
